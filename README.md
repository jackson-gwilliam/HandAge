Overview
HandAge leverages the 11K Hands dataset to predict biological age from dorsal hand images using computer vision. A ResNet-18 model was trained using the dorsal images from the 11K dataset and analyzes multiple hand phenotypes as aging biomarkers, contributing to multimodal biological age prediction that could be used alongside other approaches like facial analysis approaches.

Technical Approach
Dataset: 11K Hands dataset for dorsal hand image analysis
Model: ResNet-18 architecture for age prediction
Target: Biological age estimation from hand-based aging biomarkers
Integration: Designed to complement FaceAge research for comprehensive age estimation
